    <p>
      Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes,
      is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.
      Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.
      Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes.
      Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence,
      it can develop in adults.
      Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure.
      Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.
